Internet Technology Fundamentals Toolkit (Written highly for personal use)
Creates to function as fundering of all stuff IT, as I' passionated about Cloud, security and try navigating through the world of technology, it sucks losing knowledge on stuff like networkin, DNS, DHCP IPv4 HTTP all that stuff. I'll start very basic
and built stuff on top of the docs. I'll use as much information already existing like linux journey to include hands-on projects. I will use as much online existing resources as possible. Feel free to let me know any potential missing resources if not mentioned.

As IT is very broad wider variety of different aspects require the same fundamentals. Some things you just got to know, that's why starting out with the first ... chapters is important. ---It's not all specifically IT but just subjects around connectivity for example which can't be missed as a person working in IT---

* Operating systems
* BOOT Proccess(es)
* Technology devices and components
* (WIFI and) Internet Connectivity
* Internet browsers and privacy

"learn RFC2616, learn something"

- Server(s) infrastrucutre
- DNS
- DHCP
- Cloud infrastructure
- Active directory
- Cloud manufacturers (Microsoft Entra ID), Amazon,
- Cisco standards

* Commandprompts and shells
* UNIX systems

Towards building this project I began to gain more enthusiasm on building a Homelab as it it's a way to make mistakes and play around, witouth the pressure of knowledge, doing the either right or wrong thing. This is my personal advice as from the above subjects building a Homelab besides this will give more hands-on experience. This is however my personal preference and it just seems fun, so it nowhere a hard requirement. I also planned to setup a simple webpage with the stuff that I'm working on in the future, but I want to host it om my own server. I than came across a guy in a Metal Discord channel who was running Proxmox and those toogether got me sucked in the Homelab rabbithole.
