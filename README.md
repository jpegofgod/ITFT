Internet Technology Fundamentals Toolkit 
Creates to function as fundering of all stuff IT, as I' passionated about Cloud, security and try navigating through the world of technology, it sucks losing knowledge on stuff like networkin, DNS, DHCP IPv4 HTTP all that stuff. I'll start very basic
and built stuff on top of the docs. I'll use as much information already existing like linux journey to include hands-on projects. 

As IT is very broad wider variety of different aspects require the same fundamentals. Some things you just got to know, that's why starting out with the first ... chapters is important. It's not all specifically IT but just subjects around connectivity for example which can't be missed as a person working in IT:

* Operating systems
* Technology devices and components
* WIFI and Internet Connectivity
* Internet browsers and privacy
